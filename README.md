<p> <strong>What is a TOCON?</strong><br />
  A TOCON is a 5 Volt powered UV   photodetector with integrated amplifier converting UV radiation into a 0   … 5V volt-age output. The V out pin of the TOCON can be directly   connected to a controller, a voltmeter or any other data analyz-ing   device with voltage input. Highly modern electronic components and a   hermetically sealed metal housing with UV glass window eliminates noise   caused by parasitic resistance paths inside the package or EMI. A TOCON   is a per-fect solution for each industrial UV sensing application   starting from flame detection at pW/cm2 level up to UV curing lamp   control at W/cm2 level. This thirteen orders of magnitude range is   covered by ten different TOCONs that differ by their sensitivity. The   TOCONs are produced as UV broadband sensors or with filters for   selective measurement.</p>
